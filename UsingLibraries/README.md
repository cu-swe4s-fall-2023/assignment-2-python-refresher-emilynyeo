# Climate Change in North America

It's unfortunately no longer a myth that our planet is being 
harmed by our brutal human ways. Using longitudinal data 
collected over the years, below is a figure that shows:

- A: The rise in average temperatures in North American 
Countries over the years.
- B: The rise in total emissions in Northern american 
Countries over the years. 
- C: The total emmisions of these Nothern American 
countries in relation to the countries GDP estimates for that 
year. 
- D: The rise in total population (male and female) of 
each country over the years.

With so much accumulative evidence, climate change 
unfortunately is undeniable :(
