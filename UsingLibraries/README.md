# Climate Change in North America

It's unfortunately no longer a myth that our planet is being 
harmed by our brutal human ways. Using longitudinal data 
collected over the years, below is a figure that shows:

- A: The rise in average temperatures in North American 
Countries over the years.
- B: The rise in total emissions in Northern american 
Countries over the years. 
- C: The total emmisions of these Nothern American 
countries in relation to the countries GDP estimates for that 
year. 
- D: The rise in total population (male and female) of 
each country over the years.

With so much accumulative evidence, climate change 
unfortunately is undeniable :(  

### If I had all the resources in the world:

I would collect the data to make a comprehensive report to emphasize the reality and seriousness of climate change. Here are some of the things I would include:

- Global Temperature Trends:
Historical temperature records from various sources, including ground-based stations, satellites, and ocean buoys, showing the long-term increase in global temperatures.
- Ice and Glacier Mass Loss:
Satellite imagery and data showcasing the decline in ice mass and glacier retreat in polar regions and high-altitude areas. This could include specific examples, such as the shrinking of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.
- Sea Level Rise Data:
Data on rising sea levels over time, measured from tide gauges and satellite altimeters. This could include projections for future sea level rise based on different climate scenarios.
- Ocean Acidification:
Measurements and data illustrating the increase in acidity of the world's oceans due to the absorption of excess carbon dioxide. This can be accompanied by impacts on marine life, particularly on coral reefs and shell-forming organisms.
- Extreme Weather Events:
Comprehensive records and analysis of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, floods, and heatwaves, linking them to changing climate patterns.
- Biodiversity Loss:
Data on the decline of various species and ecosystems as a result of changing climate conditions. This could include information on habitat loss, migration pattern shifts, and endangered species.
- Carbon Dioxide Concentrations:
Historical and current data on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, demonstrating the correlation with industrial activities and fossil fuel burning.
- Human Impact and Vulnerability:
Figures and case studies illustrating the impact of climate change on human communities, including displacement, food security issues, and increased vulnerability in certain regions.
