# first commit

Completed the implementation of get_column() in my_utils.py such that
a. get_column() opened the file named file_name and processed it line by line
b. for each line
	i. split the line into an array.
	ii. checked to see if the value in the query_column position of the array matches the value stored in the query_value variable.
	iii. when the above condition was met, added the value in the result_column position to an array.
c. returned the array storing the column values.

# second commit
